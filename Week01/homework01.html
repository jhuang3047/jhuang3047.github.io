        <br> The video was overall very intriguing. Before watching the video, I 
        did not see the invention of photography and film as something that head
        negatively impacted the world. I saw the idea of reproduction and printing 
        of images as something that connected the world in a way since it would allow 
        people to have access to different types of art. However, the video opened  my eyes to the idea
        that art would lose its original meaning as specific works of art were being printed 
        and reproduced. This allowed for different meanings and interpretations of such art
        that strayed further away from its intended meaning. I found this idwa to be particularly
        interesting because when I think about art, I see it as something that can have different interpretations
        and that there is no correct way to interpret some forms of art. But, now I realize that 
        this is not always the case. The video also showed me how sound and motion can alter 
        the interpretaton of art. It was eye opening to see how music and movement of the camera 
        changed how I saw the art. In the video, he shows different scenes that could potentially 
        correlate to a work of art. The first video had a much happier mood whereas the other video was more serious.
        The first video made the painting seem more upbeat and the second video made the same
        painting seem to be a more serious matter.
