        <h3>Ways of Seeing </h3>
        <h1>Response to Video</h1>
        <br> The video was overall very intriguing. Before watching this video, I did not see
        the invention of photography and film as something that had negatively
        impacted the world. I saw the idea of reproduction and printing of images
        as something that connected the world in a way since it would allow people
        to have access to different types of art. However, the video opened up
        my eyes to the idea that art would lose its original meaning as specific
        works of art were being printed and reproduced. This allowed for different meanings 
        and interpretations of such art that strayed further away from its intended 
        meaning. I found this idea to be particularly interesting because when I think 
        about art, I see it as something that can have different interpretations and that 
        there is no correct way to interpret some forms of art. But, now I realize that 
        this is not always the case. The video also showed me how sound and motion affects 
        the interpretation of art as well. I did not realize how much sound and motion 
        can alter the interpretation of art. It was eye opening to see how music and movement of the 
        camera changed how I saw the art. Lastly, another idea that stood out to me was how context 
        can also affect art. In the video, he shows different scenes that could potentially correlate 
        to a work of art. The first video had a much happier mood whereas the other video was more serious. 
        The first video made the painting seem more upbeat and the second video made the same painting appear 
        to be a more serious matter.
