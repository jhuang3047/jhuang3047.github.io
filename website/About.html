        <p id="about">
           I am currently an undergraduate student studying for a bachelor's in Integrated Digital Media at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.
           I have been exploring the world of design since high school and I am enhancing my graphic design skills.
           
            <br><br>

            I've explored different types of design and tech like 3D modelling and web development. 
            I've also found my interests outside of design, such as photography and food science.
            I am always eager to learn new things and also develop the skill sets that I currently have. 
            <br><br>
