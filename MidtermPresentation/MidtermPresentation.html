<p> My goal was to create a website for the store I currently work at. I am not completely satisfied with 
    some elements of my final work but I am pretty happy with how it came out. I did not 
    expect to spend as much time as I did and I feel like I could continue 
working on the organization of my code and naming classes & ids. I feel that if someone else were to look 
at it they would think it is pretty chaotic. But, I feel that I was able to incorporate many interactive 
elements which I am pretty satisfied with.   </p>
