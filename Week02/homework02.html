<body><h3>Response to "As We May Think" & "Long Live the Web"</h3></body>

    <main>
    
    
      <p>Both articles were intriguing because they dealt 
        with similar concepts although written in <br>different time periods.  In "As We May Think," Vannevar Bush urges his 
        fellow scientists <br>to try to focus on spreading knowledge instead of creating things to make their lives easier. 
       <br> In "Long Live the Web," Tim Berners-Lee talks about a simiar idea using linked data. I found <br> this to be interesting because I did not know how constricted 
we were on the web and how <br> little we actually know. It was crazy to learn that even though we have access to many things 
<br> on the web, we do not actually know that much about how it operates. Both authors encourage <br>the sharing of information
and to overcome the  obstacles that it may raise and I think that is <br>something that we should actually look into. </p>
