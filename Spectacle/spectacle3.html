        <div class="quote2">"The spectacle subjugates living men to itself to the extent that the economy
             has totally subjugated them. It is no more than the economy developing for itself. 
             It is the true reflection of the production of things, and the false objectification of the producers." Another aspect of 
            the spectacle, is capitalism and how it controls our lives. </div>
